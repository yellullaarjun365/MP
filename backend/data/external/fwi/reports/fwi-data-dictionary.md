# Data Dictionary

This document describes all columns in each dataset.

> **Note:** ARA is a program that has evolved significantly over time. We have added, tested, and discontinued various parameters to refine our data collection process. The data we collect today is much more targeted compared to what we gathered during the program's early stages.
>
> Additionally, different measurement types require different parameters to be filled out in our forms. For example, we only suggest corrective actions when water quality parameters fall outside the acceptable range. As such, the field "Corrective actions requested" will not always be filled in. Similarly, some measurements (e.g., turbidity) are only taken in the morning, as we found that evening measurements show negligible differences.
>
> As a result, you may notice several empty or "NA" columns. These do not represent missing data but rather data that we deliberately chose not to collect.
>
> If you have any questions regarding this data, please feel free to contact us at [fwi.fish/contact](https://fwi.fish/contact).

## water_quality.csv

Water quality measurements collected during farm visits. We take most measurements in the morning and evening. For some parameters that don't change significantly throughout the day (e.g. turbidity and ammonia), we only collect the morning measurement.

### Key Data

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Date of data collection` | Date of measurement |
| `Time of data collection` | Exact time of measurement |
| `pond_id` | Anonymized pond identifier (replaces original Pond ID) |
| `region` | Geographic region derived from pond ID: Eluru (WG) or Nellore (NL) |
| `Type` | Time of day: Morning or Evening |

### Measurement Information

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Is follow up` | Whether this is a follow-up measurement. Per the [ARA Commitment](https://fwi.fish/commitment), farmers must maintain water quality in particular ranges. When water quality is outside of range, our team recommends a corrective action and returns to the farm in 1-3 days to follow up; otherwise, measurements are typically taken monthly. This column is "Yes" if this measurement was a follow-up visit. |
| `Is follow up possible` | Whether a follow-up measurement was possible to schedule |
| `Reason follow up not possible` | If follow-up was not possible, the reason why |
| `Group` | Internal grouping used to organize farms, based on either frequency of observed issues and/or participation in certain studies. Values include: Regular ara pond, Focus group 2/3/4, Ara v1 2 weekly, Ara v12 monthly, Ara v12 weekly, Outcome evaluation, and others. |
| `Pond status` | Treatment, Control, or Assessment. Note: "Assessment" farms were treated as control farms. Some controls may not be fully unbiased, so caution is advised when comparing treatment/control outcomes. |
| `Observer` | FWI staff member who recorded the measurement |
| `Equipment` | Measurement equipment used. Note: Using different equipment is one source of measurement variation, as different meters may measure the same water at slightly different values. In our experience, the most accurate measurements are: **DO: Winkler's Method** and **Ammonia: Photometer**. For pH and other parameters, any equipment listed is accurate as methods have remained consistent. |
| `Weather` | Weather conditions during measurement |

| `Parameters out of range` | List of parameters outside acceptable range, if any |

### Corrective Actions (FWI-Prescribed)

These columns relate to corrective actions that FWI staff recommend to farmers when water quality is out of range.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

### Self-Initiated Corrective Actions

These columns track corrective actions that farmers took on their own initiative, without FWI recommendation.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Self-initiated corrective actions taken` | Actions the farmer took independently |
| `Self-initiated corrective actions implemented on (exact date)` | Exact date of self-initiated action |
| `Self-initiated corrective actions implemented (date range)` | Approximate date range (e.g., "0-7 days ago") |
| `Self-initiated corrective actions notes` | Notes about self-initiated actions |

### Behavioral Indicators

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|

### Acceptable Ranges ([ARA Commitment](https://fwi.fish/commitment))

| Parameter | Required Range | Ideal Range |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Dissolved Oxygen (Morning) | 3 – 5 mg/L | 4 – 5 mg/L |
| Dissolved Oxygen (Evening) | 8 – 12 mg/L | 8 – 10 mg/L |
| pH | 6.5 – 8.5 | 7 – 8 |
| Ammonia (TAN) | < 0.5 mg/L (threshold until Aug 2025) | |
| Ammonia (NH₃) | < 0.05 mg/L (threshold from Aug 2025) | |

Note that we have previously included turbidity and temperature as critical parameters, so data from earlier years may include these for the in-range/out-of-range classification. We have since excluded some of these parameters because either they tend to not be as important as we previously thought or we cannot actively control them (in which case we still monitor them).

### Ammonia Measurement Protocol Change (August 2025)

In August 2025, FWI changed how ammonia is measured. For details, see: [Changes in our Ammonia Measurement Protocols](https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/ammonia-change)

**Why the change?** Unionized ammonia (NH₃) is the form that is directly toxic to fish. The proportion of toxic NH₃ in total ammonia increases with pH and temperature, so measuring only Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN) gives an incomplete picture of ammonia toxicity.

**The three ammonia columns:**

| Column | Period | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `Ammonia—TAN (NH3-N) (mg/L)` | Until Aug 2025 | Total Ammonia Nitrogen. Old measurement method. |
| `Ammonia—NH3 (mg/L)` | Aug 2025 onwards | Unionized ammonia (NH₃). New primary metric—the directly toxic form. |
| `Ammonia—TAN (NH3) (mg/L)` | Aug 2025 onwards | TAN expressed as NH₃. Used during transition for comparison. |

**Note:** During the transition period (Aug 2025 onwards), both old and new metrics may be tracked. Earlier records will only have the TAN column populated.

## Cross-Dataset Consistency

The `pond_id` column is consistent across all datasets. The same anonymised ID refers to the same
physical pond in water_quality.csv, enrolled_ponds.csv, stocking_harvest.csv, and dropouts.csv.

> **Pond IDs changed in v2.0.0.** They are randomly generated and bear no relationship to the IDs
> used in the January 2026 release. Analysis built on the earlier IDs will not join to this data.

The `region` column is derived from the original pond ID prefix and indicates the geographic area:
- **Eluru (WG)**: Coastal district in Andhra Pradesh (formerly part of West Godavari district, before the 2022 redistricting; internal pond IDs retain the "WG" prefix from the original designation)
- **Nellore (NL)**: Coastal district in Andhra Pradesh

---

## Data Collection Notes

- **Morning vs Evening**: Most water quality parameters are collected twice daily. Some parameters (like turbidity) are only collected in the morning as evening measurements showed negligible differences.

- **Follow-up measurements**: When water quality is out of range, FWI returns within 1-3 days to check if corrective actions were effective. Regular measurements occur approximately monthly.

- **Equipment variation**: Different measurement equipment may produce slightly different readings. The Equipment column indicates which tools were used for each measurement.

- **Self-reported data**: Fish weight is self-reported by farmers rather than measured by FWI staff.

---

## Column naming: a join hazard

`Date of data collection` does **not** mean the same thing in every file:

| File | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `water_quality.csv` | date the measurement was taken |
| `enrolled_ponds.csv` | date the pond was enrolled and surveyed |

Concatenating these files on that column will mix measurement dates with
enrolment dates. Join on `pond_id`, and treat the date columns separately.

## Undocumented and empty columns

`Fish source` (enrolled_ponds.csv) records where a pond's fish came from,
generalised to a category: Own pond, Hatchery, Nursery pond, Local market,
Local farmers, Individual supplier. Free-text supplier names were replaced,
since a named local supplier can identify an individual farm.

`Data verification notes` (stocking_harvest.csv) held internal verification
commentary. It is retained as an empty column so the schema matches the
source system.

These columns are present but hold no values in any row:

| File | Empty columns |
|------|---------------|
| `water_quality.csv` | Alkalinity (mg/L), Hardness (mg/L) |
| `stocking_harvest.csv` | Data verified by, Data verification notes, and average weight for Mrigal, Common Carp, Whiteleg Shrimp and Pangasius |

As the preamble notes, an empty column generally means a parameter we chose
not to collect, not data that went missing.

---

## Changes in v3.0.0 (August 2026)

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| `pond_id` namespace changed | Identifiers now use an `ara2_` prefix. Previous releases used `pond_`, which meant identifiers from different releases were indistinguishable by eye and a stale reference could pass unnoticed. A join across releases now fails visibly rather than partially matching in silence. |
| Financial figures removed from notes | Free-text notes containing sale prices, seed costs or earnings were removed in full. The structured INR columns had been dropped in 2.0.1, but the same figures had been recorded as prose, so the exclusion was not actually in effect. |
| Harvest weights: a known gap | Some removed notes were the only record of a harvest weight. Where `Fish harvested (total, in kg)` is empty for a harvest event, the weight is unrecorded in this release rather than zero. |
| `Sr. No` removed | Internal database row counter with no analytical value. |
| `Fish source` generalised | See above. |
| Free-text notes reviewed | Notes naming individuals removed. References to other ponds now use published identifiers, and any reference that could not be resolved was redacted. |
| Coverage extended | Now runs to August 2026; the January 2026 release ended 31 January. |

## Known data issues

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Duplicate pond registration | One pond appears twice in `enrolled_ponds.csv` with differing property area, pond area and depth, recorded in surveys about four years apart. Both records are retained rather than one being silently chosen. |
| Future-dated event | One stocking event in `stocking_harvest.csv` is dated after the release date, most likely a planned event recorded as actual. |
| Missing harvest weights | See the note on removed financial content above. |
